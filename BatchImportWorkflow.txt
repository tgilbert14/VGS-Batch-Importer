>Create protocol for sample insert
>Edit/Update generic electronic sheet for transcription OR
Obtain historical sheets and evaluate if data can be wrangled
>Create Client specific scripts for site info/creation, data wrangling
per event type (e.g., LPI, freq, gc, ect.)
>Update app UI/server for Forest/Region of data sheets
>Import data in 'Power Mode', this bypasses many input errors and will
generate a r_output file with errors to be fixed (e.g., species codes, gc counts, etc.)
>Update SpeciesReplace sheet with species to override incorrect ones
>Run in SpeciesReplace mode, see if any errors
>May need to adjust individual sheets or develop code to work with all imports or
specific imports
>Once all obvious errors corrected, run batch import with speciesReplace on
>Send species count output file to POCs for any possible corrections
>Check data for errors, pick ~5-10% of random data and intensely evaluate that the data
is being inserted as expected (depended on import size)
>Merge sites with multiple years data (or develop script to merge them)
>Go through Site and Protocol Notes and fix obvious spelling errors
>Checking location coordinates make sense for site name and folder structure
>Get rid of duplicate locators from merge
>Update to USFS naming convention
>Run comparison reports to see for species conflicts (or develop script)
>Test reporting options work and that data is displays as expected
>Put data on DEV to test, then PROD if everything looks good!
